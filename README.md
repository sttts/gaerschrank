# G채rschrank

G채rschrank is a cabinet to keep a constant temperature (e.g. 25째C) for many hours, to let mother dough for pizza or bread grow reliably. There was no good product on the market for home kitchens. So I constructed one myself. It can be built by reasonably advanced makers in a home workshop. Compare the [PDF manual](https://github.com/sttts/gaerschrank/raw/main/manual.pdf) and the [BOM sourcing guide in a Google Sheet (comments are open)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iQExdZlAbJB_AZ4Cb8j4MoTpXGVJk9_lcCnTzCELtOU/edit?usp=sharing).
